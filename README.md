# BeerPersonalization
The goal of this project is to create a beer recommendation system using popular personalization algorithms such as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization. We hope build a model that can suggest users new beers to try based on their preferences

For this exercise, we used data from the popular beer review website BeerAdvocate.com (available at https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-BeerAdvocate.html).
During the first phase, we focused on implementing two simple algorithms to predict the user ratings for certain beers. We tested and compared the result of collaborative filtering approaches (both item and user based) and matrix factorization. Both models were developed using only the overall beer ratings, but we plan to expand the number of features in future iterations
